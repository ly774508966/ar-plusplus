# AR++
AR++ is a collection of interaction components to be used with Apple's ARKit. The goal of this project is to build a library of fundamental building blocks so that developers looking to dive into ARKit don't need to reinvent the wheel for every single interaction between the real and virtual worlds.

---

## Getting Started
  - Create a new project in Unity 5.6.2 or newer
  - Import the latest version of the [ARKit Unity plugin][UnityARKitPlugin]
  - Clone or download this repo
  - Drag and drop the AR++ folder into your Assets folder
  - Poke around the `AR++/Examples/` folder to see how some of the basic components work together

## Current Components & Examples
- GazeListener for using a reticle as a mouse/cursor
- Touch listener for projecting a 2D screen touch into the 3D space
- Basic object manipulation and interaction (move, scale, rotate, pickup, putdown, etc.)
- Virtual Joystick controls
- Ruler

## TODO
- Add more components:
-- 3D Painting system
-- More Measurement Components: Multipoint Lines, Curves, Cirumference, Surface Area of Polygon, Volume of a given set of vertices
-- Portals
-- AR Selfies
- Create example applications
- Write basic documentation
- Throw some screenshots in here
- Write or record a few development tutorials
- Think of more stuff to do
